# Owlishly Documentation

The owlishly system is a complex serverless web application that
involves several separate systems all working together.  This documentation
is intended to help developers get up to speed working with the 
code.

## Donations and Registrations

Churches and non profits need a simple way to handle online donations and event registrations.  There are many available options out there, but nothing that gives a combination of all the features required.  

For example, a church may have a summer day camp, a music concert and a conference all in the same month.  The day camp would require group registrations for an event that could last a week, the concert would have reserved seating with different prices (depending on the quality of the seats) and the conference may require several break out sessions.  In addition, part of the cost of the event may be tax deductible.  .  

Our example would require at least 3 online systems plus a separate manual process with the bookkeeping software.
