# Deployment

This project is split across several repositories. As a result, deployment must be managed through an external CI tool.

We use [https://seed.run]() to manage our API deployments.

By default, all commits to the master branch will be automatically deployed to the staging/dev environment in AWS. 

TODO:

- Figure out the react deployment methodology
